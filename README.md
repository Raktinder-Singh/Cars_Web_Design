A simple website called "Car Curiosity." This is just the designing of the website. No work is done on the backend. Here's a brief description of the code:

Head Section:

The head section contains meta tags for character set, compatibility, and viewport settings.
The title of the webpage is set to "Car Curiosity."
Favicon (shortcut icon) is linked to an image located at "E:\Car_Curiosity\images\logo3.jpg."
External stylesheets are linked, including "E:\Car_Curiosity\css\index2.css" and Font Awesome icons.
Body Section:

The body section contains a navigation bar (nav) with a logo ("C-Curiosity") and menu items (Home, About us, Top 10).
Another navigation bar with links to different sections (Muscle Cars, Sports Cars, History, Properties) is present.
A search bar (search-bar) with an input box and a search button is displayed.
The search form has an action pointing to a local file (file:///E:/Car_Curiosity/dodge.html).
Three sections (container) display information about specific cars using cards (card).
Each card includes a background image, the name of the car, a brief description, and a "READ MORE" link to a corresponding HTML file.
An "About Us" section (about) provides information about the website.
A footer (footer) contains four columns with links and social media icons.
The script tag at the end links to a JavaScript file called "search.js."
About Us Section:

There's a section with the id "about" containing the heading "ABOUT US" and a content paragraph describing the purpose of the website.
Footer Section:

The footer includes links to different sections, such as "About us," "Services," and "Privacy Policy."
Social media links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) are represented by Font Awesome icons.
Script Section:

The script tag at the end references an external JavaScript file called "search.js."
Note: Ensure that the file paths for images, stylesheets, and JavaScript are correct and accessible. Also, consider using relative paths instead of absolute paths for better portability.
